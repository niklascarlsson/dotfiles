* About

This dotfile setup is heavily inspired/borderline stolen from [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][hlissner's
dotfiles]]. I have also taken inspiration from others such as [[https://github.com/noctuid][noctuid]]. My ambition
has been to craft a setup that is highly focused on being ~minimalistic~,
~keyboardriven~, and ~highly customizable~.

TODO: Why I keep it in org-mode

* Inspiration

I found that ~Protesilaos Stavrou~ have an interesting video about scripting a
dynamic desktop setup. I will look into that sometime, [[https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2019-06-17-bspwm-dynamic-desktops/][bspwm-dynamic-desktops]].
