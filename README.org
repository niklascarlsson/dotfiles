* About

This dotfile setup is heavily inspired/borderline stolen from [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][hlissner's
dotfiles]]. I have also taken inspiration from others such as [[https://github.com/noctuid][noctuid]]. My ambition
has been to craft a setup that is highly focused on being ~minimalistic~,
~keyboardriven~, and ~highly customizable~.

TODO: Why I keep it in org-mode
