* About

My dotfiles for [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux]] and [[https://ubuntu.com/][Ubuntu]], organized and managed through [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] and
[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode]].

* Background

I wanted to improve my knowledge on Linux, shell scripting and Emacs. So I
combined all of that into this project of creating a dotfile setup using
~Org-mode~.

Focus has been on creating a setup that favors keyboard interaction, has a
minimalist design and is highly customizable.

* Screenshots

All the credit for the design esthetic should go to [[https://github.com/hlissner/dotfiles][hlissner]], I have graciously
copied most of it from his dotfiles.

installation of the applications that this environment depends on.
